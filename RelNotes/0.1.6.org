#+Title: Magithub Release 0.1.6
#+Date:

#+LINK: PR https://www.github.com/vermiculus/magithub/pull/%s

* Breaking Changes
- If you were using ~magit-header-line~ to customize the appearance of
  the =Issues= and =Pull Requests= section headers, those now use the
  ~magit-section-heading~ face.  [[PR:196]]

* New Features
- Browse commits by using =w= on a commit section.
- ~magithub-feature-autoinject~ can now take a list of features to load.
- Many symbols are now supported by ~thing-at-point~:
  - =github-user=
  - =github-issue=
  - =github-label=
  - =github-comment=
  - =github-repository=
  - =github-pull-request=
  - =github-notification=
  These symbols should allow other GitHub-sensitive packages to use
  the work Magithub has already done without depending on Magithub
  directly.  [[PR:201]]

* Bug Fixes
- In ~magithub-repo~, an API request is no longer made when the
  repository contect cannot be determined.
- The list of labels is now correctly cached per-repository.  [[PR:203]]
- The full list of labels is now available for use when modifying
  issues and pull requests.  [[PR:203]]
