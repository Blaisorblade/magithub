#+LINK: PR https://www.github.com/vermiculus/magithub/pull/%s

* Breaking Changes
- If you were using ~magit-header-line~ to customize the appearance of
  the =Issues= and =Pull Requests= section headers, those now use the
  ~magit-section-heading~ face.  [[PR:196]]
- Many functions related to issue/post creation have been reworked.
  Instead of the widget framework, we now use =magithub-edit-mode=.  See
  more details in 'New Features'.  [[PR:204]]

* New Features
- Browse commits by using =w= on a commit section.  If the current
  section's value cannot be understood as a valid commit, use the
  =git-revision= at point.
- ~magithub-feature-autoinject~ can now take a list of features to load.
- Many symbols are now supported by ~thing-at-point~:
  - =github-user=
  - =github-issue=
  - =github-label=
  - =github-comment=
  - =github-repository=
  - =github-pull-request=
  - =github-notification=
  These symbols should allow other GitHub-sensitive packages to use
  the work Magithub has already done without depending on Magithub
  directly.  [[PR:201]]
- The widget interface for writing issues and pull requests is gone!
  Now, everything uses the framework debuted for writing comments.
  For issues and pull requests, the first line (i.e., everything up to
  the first newline character) is parsed as the title; everything else
  as the body.  Now issues, pull requests, and comments use a common
  interface that supports submitting, cancelling, and saving drafts to
  finish later.  [[PR:204]]
- You can now edit comments using =e= on a comment section.  [[PR:206]]

* Bug Fixes
- In ~magithub-repo~, an API request is no longer made when the
  repository contect cannot be determined.
- The list of labels is now correctly cached per-repository.  [[PR:203]]
- The full list of labels is now available for use when modifying
  issues and pull requests.  [[PR:203]]
- The cache (and other files in =magithub-dir=) are no longer added to
  the =recentf= list.  [[PR:210]]
- Consistently use ~magithub-request~.  [[PR:229]]
- ~magit-magithub-pull-request-section-map~ is now defined in terms of
  ~magit-magithub-issue-section-map~.  [[PR:238]]
- Fix autoloads to load and install the dispatch with Magit.  [[PR:238]]
- Remove awkward blank lines from the end of the dashboard.  [[PR:238]]
